624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	lavoisier 's quantitative experiments revealed that combustion involved oxygen rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	the law of conservation of mass , or principle of mass conservation , states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy ( both of which have mass ) , the mass of the system must remain constant over time , as system mass can not change quantity if it is not added or removed .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	hence , the quantity of mass is `` conserved '' over time .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	the law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed , although it may be rearranged in space , or the entities associated with it may be changed in form , as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributed .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	the law implies ( requires ) that during any chemical reaction , nuclear reaction , or radioactive decay in an isolated system , the mass of the reactants or starting material must equal the mass of the products .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	the concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry , mechanics , and fluid dynamics .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	historically , mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by antoine lavoisier in the late 18th century , and was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	the closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory , but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical calculations , even in modern practice .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	in special relativity , needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved , the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important , since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for so-called isolated systems , i.e . those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environment .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	in this circumstance , the mass-energy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation , which is the first law of thermodynamics .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	by contrast , for a thermodynamically closed system ( i.e. , one which is closed to exchanges of matter , but open to exchanges of non-material energy , such as heat and work , with the surroundings ) mass is ( usually ) only approximately conserved .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	the input or output of non-material energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory , although the change is usually small , since relatively large amounts of such energy ( by comparison with ordinary experience ) carry only a small amount of mass ( again by ordinary standards of measurement ) .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	in special relativity , mass is not converted to energy , since energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation or translocation into , or out of , a system .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	however , certain types of matter ( a different concept ) may be converted to energy , so long as the mass of the system is unchanged in the process .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	however , if such energy is removed from systems , they must lose the mass that is associated with it .	0
624wikiqa	what implication ( s ) does the law of conservation of matter have for humans ?	in general relativity , mass ( and energy ) conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex concept , subject to different definitions , and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in minkowski space .	0

678wikiqa	what can electrical energy be transformed into	such energy is sometimes considered `` degraded energy , '' because it is not entirely usable .	0
678wikiqa	what can electrical energy be transformed into	the second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that , for this reason , thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100 % , only if the entropy ( even-ness or disorder ) of the universe is increased by other means , to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content .	0
678wikiqa	what can electrical energy be transformed into	otherwise , only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy ( and thus , useful work ) , since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature , in such a way that the increase in entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy .	0
